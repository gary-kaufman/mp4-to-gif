# MP4 to GIF Converter

This script uses the `moviepy` package to quickly convert an `mp4` video to `gif` format.

## How to Use

1. Install `moviepy` with pip.
2. Place your `.mp4` file in the root directory.
3. Change filename on line 5 to match your filename.
4. Change files name to your liking on line 7.
5. Run script.

I used the `fps` parameter to fine tune the way the `gif` was produced.
